This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.</p></li><li><p>Sitemate graduated from Australia’s #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate.</p></li><li><p>Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ’s #1 Vc), Shearwater Growth Capital & Marbruck Investments.</p></li><li><p>See info on our latest raise <a class=\"_mizu1p6i _1ah3dkaa _ra3xnqa1 _128mdkaa _1cvmnqa1 _4davt94y _ymio1r31 _ypr0glyw _zcxs1o36 _4bfu1r31 _1hms8stv _ajmmnqa1 _vchhusvi _kqswh2mm _syaz14q2 _ect41gqc _1a3b1r31 _4fpr8stv _5goinqa1 _f8pj14q2 _9oik1r31 _1bnxglyw _jf4cnqa1 _30l314q2 _1nrm1r31 _c2waglyw _1iohnqa1 _9h8h16c2 _1053w7te _1ienw7te _n0fxw7te _1vhvg3x0\" href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/software-start-up-likened-to-atlassian-defies-funding-slump-raising-27-5-million-20241217-p5kyxp.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the working environment like at Sitemate?</strong></p><ul><li><p>We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.</p></li><li><p>We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.</p></li><li><p>We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.</p></li><li><p>You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.</p></li><li><p>You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries.

We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get 1000s of new leads in our core/target regions with 0 cold calling and limited marketing spend (made possible by strong word-of-mouth and organic marketing efforts).</p></li><li><p>Sitemate’s founders have diverse backgrounds - one coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects; the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.</p></li><li><p>Sitemate graduated from Australia’s #1 Technology Company Accelerator - Startmate.</p></li><li><p>Sitemate has strong financial backing from Blackbird (Australia and NZ’s #1 Vc), Shearwater Growth Capital & Marbruck Investments.</p></li><li><p>See info on our latest raise <a class=\"_mizu1p6i _1ah3dkaa _ra3xnqa1 _128mdkaa _1cvmnqa1 _4davt94y _ymio1r31 _ypr0glyw _zcxs1o36 _4bfu1r31 _1hms8stv _ajmmnqa1 _vchhusvi _kqswh2mm _syaz14q2 _ect41gqc _1a3b1r31 _4fpr8stv _5goinqa1 _f8pj14q2 _9oik1r31 _1bnxglyw _jf4cnqa1 _30l314q2 _1nrm1r31 _c2waglyw _1iohnqa1 _9h8h16c2 _1053w7te _1ienw7te _n0fxw7te _1vhvg3x0\" href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/technology/software-start-up-likened-to-atlassian-defies-funding-slump-raising-27-5-million-20241217-p5kyxp.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>here</u></a>.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the working environment like at Sitemate?</strong></p><ul><li><p>We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.</p></li><li><p>We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.</p></li><li><p>We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.</p></li><li><p>You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.</p></li><li><p>You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.</p></li><li><p>We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!</p></li></ul><p><strong>What does Sitemate do, exactly?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.</p></li><li><p>Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.</p></li><li><p>This role is for Sitemate’s 3rd product, Gearbelt - Gearbelt is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their fleet management processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.</p></li></ul><p>See some of our user reviews for Dashpivot here:</p><ul><li><p><a class=\"_mizu1p6i _1ah3dkaa _ra3xnqa1 _128mdkaa _1cvmnqa1 _4davt94y _ymio1r31 _ypr0glyw _zcxs1o36 _4bfu1r31 _1hms8stv _ajmmnqa1 _vchhusvi _kqswh2mm _syaz14q2 _ect41gqc _1a3b1r31 _4fpr8stv _5goinqa1 _f8pj14q2 _9oik1r31 _1bnxglyw _jf4cnqa1 _30l314q2 _1nrm1r31 _c2waglyw _1iohnqa1 _9h8h16c2 _1053w7te _1ienw7te _n0fxw7te _1vhvg3x0\" href=\"https://www.g2.com/products/dashpivot/reviews\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>G2 Crowd</u></a></p></li><li><p><a class=\"_mizu1p6i _1ah3dkaa _ra3xnqa1 _128mdkaa _1cvmnqa1 _4davt94y _ymio1r31 _ypr0glyw _zcxs1o36 _4bfu1r31 _1hms8stv _ajmmnqa1 _vchhusvi _kqswh2mm _syaz14q2 _ect41gqc _1a3b1r31 _4fpr8stv _5goinqa1 _f8pj14q2 _9oik1r31 _1bnxglyw _jf4cnqa1 _30l314q2 _1nrm1r31 _c2waglyw _1iohnqa1 _9h8h16c2 _1053w7te _1ienw7te _n0fxw7te _1vhvg3x0\" href=\"https://www.trustradius.com/products/dashpivot-by-sitemate/reviews?o=recent\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Trust Radius</u></a></p></li></ul><p><strong>What will I be doing in this role?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Preparing high-level concept designs to review internally, and with customers to conduct research when required.</p></li><li><p>Preparing detailed designs and UX flows, working with the product team to define scope.</p></li><li><p>Creating information architecture diagrams to explain how different product areas/components relate to each other.</p></li><li><p>Preparing and reviewing acceptance criteria.</p></li><li><p>Directly collaborating with engineers during the development cycle, coordination of in flight work and demo reviewing work completed.</p></li><li><p>Attending team meetings to clarify scope, test ideas and collect feedback.</p></li><li><p>Establish and promote design guidelines, best practices, and standards.</p></li><li><p>Contributing to release notes.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring production support for issues raised by customer support team, performing triage and ticketing up fixes if required.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?</strong></p><ul><li><p>Pace - we move very quickly, so you’ll need to be excited to come in and learn extremely fast.</p></li><li><p>Complexity - this role involves designing and optimising complex UX patterns across web and mobile platforms.</p></li><li><p>Being adaptable and versatile - apart from possessing core UX expertise, our product designers also possess/develop a solid grasp of other adjacent areas such as product and delivery.</p></li><li><p>We have a strong culture based on core values and standard operating procedures, you may need to unlearn a few things from previous experience.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What kind of skills and experience do I need to have?
