Design-led. AI-powered. Global.You’ll be working with the most complex data in the world : the human mind.Deep inside you are looking for a new adventure with…🚀Ambition : Smart teammates driven to create an iconic, international product🔥Impact : you strive to make a real difference in the company's growth, and not be a number in a big organization😍Mission : knowing your greatness left a mark in people's lives, through technology and behavioral scienceAt Paradox, we believe that greatness is trainable.That’s why we want to empower people at scale by leveraging cutting edge technologies like AI, and crafting user experiences with outstanding aesthetics.We do that by merging :- Human Intelligence (coaches, peers, and mentors)- Structured Intelligence (protocols, mental models, rituals),- Technological Intelligence (AI personalization, feedback loops, adaptive journeys)To create one seamless ecosystem: Paradox OS.This is why we are looking for a PM to make Paradox a category-defining global brand loved for its product.This is a full-time position from our beautiful offices in Dubai, Paris or Lisbon or remotely anywhere in the world.OUR BELIEFSWe believe self-help is broken.Most learning platforms are used the same way : consuming generic theories, getting quick highs, ending with no real change.At Paradox, we believe people deserve more.More than content. More than motivation.They deserve a system that knows them, one that adapts, challenges, and grows with them.We believe that every human learns differently, and that technology can do more than entertain or save time.It can translate insight into transformation, through AI personalization, lean experimentation, and deep psychological understanding.Because learning shouldn’t just make you feel inspired for a day, it should change how you live, think, and create.OUR VISIONAt Paradox, we want to re-invent how people grow.We do not build another course or coaching app but the Operating System for Greatness.Founded by David Laroche - a creator followed by over 2 million people and known for his interviews with icons like Tony Parker, Mike Horn, Richard Branson, and Gad Elmaleh, Paradox aims to build something that will live beyond any individual (including its founder), for decades to come.Our ambition is to compete with players like Mindvalley (150M ARR), but with a sharper vision, grounded protocols for achievers, people who want more for their life, refusing mediocrity.To do that, we bring together designers, tech, coaches, and filmmakers to create learning experiences that are cinematic, precise, and effective.We move fast, aim high, and hold ourselves to the standards of Apple, Spotify, and MasterClass. No fluff, focused on meaningful impact.While others hide their numbers, we want to let our results speak loudly for us.Get obsessed with transforming our clients’ lives and let those transformations be our marketing.YOUR MISSION 🚀-----------------------------------------As Product Manager, you’ll be the architect of a new category, transforming growth into a living ecosystem powered by AI, behavioral science, and design.You won’t just build features, you’ll craft experiences that rewire behavior.You’re the architect bringing clarity between vision and execution, the person who turns “we should build this” into “it’s live, here’s the data and tangible impact.”Every product cycle you lead will integrate:Protocols : guided frameworks grounded in psychology that rewire perception, emotion, and action.Pods : human connection, accountability, and shared rituals.Loops : adaptive, AI-powered coaching cycles that evolve with each user.Personalization : experiences that feel uniquely theirs, every time.Going from a successful personal brand, to an international tech-driven iconic brand, is far from easy. It will be messy, chaotic - requiring constant iterations on MVPs and innovation in tech. Therefore to achieve this here are :🎯 YOUR 6 MAIN MISSIONS-----------------------------------------1. Product Strategy :Translate the founder’s strategic vision into a clear product strategy.Build and maintain the roadmap that connects business goals, user outcomes, and technological innovation.Ensure every feature supports the evolution of the Paradox ecosystem: Loops, PX Agents, Protocols, Membership.2.

Product Analytics & Impact MeasurementDefine and track product success metrics (activation, retention, transformation rates).Connect data to business KPIs, know how your product drives lifetime value, not just engagement.We don’t track metrics just for internal dashboards, we track them also to prove transformation.Help marketing leverage this data to fuel authentic, evidence-based storytelling — showing the world what real transformation looks like.5. AI & Learning InnovationPrototype new experiences powered by AICut waste, challenge spending, increase marginOversee budgeting, reporting, planning, and auditing6. Blend emotions (“open the heart of people”) with precision (“build loops, scoring, protocols”).Create a visceral experience that translates into emotions of inspiration, awe from users.Use a Science-backed, Cinematic, Contrarian style : Every product touchpoint should be grounded in behavioral science, expressed with cinematic beauty, and challenge conventionsTHE IDEAL CANDIDATE 😍-----------------------------------------Experience :3–6 years as a Product Manager / Product Owner in EdTech, SaaS, or Consumer Tech.Bonus: experience in AI-driven products, learning design, or personal development platforms.You’ve shipped at least one major feature or product end-to-end, and can show measurable results.Uses Figma comfortably, prototypes directly.Traits :Craft-obsessed : You get things done, you love to work much beyond 9-5, you have a doer mentality, a bias for outcomes and want to be a beast in your fieldUser & Impact Obsessed: You think in outcomes, not outputs, you care about transformation.Analytical & System Thinker: You can turn a vague problem into a clear hypothesis, metrics, and roadmap.Digital & AI savvy : you’re able to build AI Agents (if not, you demonstrate ability to learn while applying).Cross-disciplinary Curiosity: You speak both tech and human; You can move from vision to spreadsheet to FigmaLanguageFrench : nativeEnglish: Fluent English, you can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues.Our chosen language for written communication is English.IT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU--------------------------------❌ If you need clarity before chaos — wrong place.❌ If you prefer balance over intensity — wrong season.❌ If you build to deliver, not to elevate — wrong mission.❌Surface-level Vision Alignment : Like the idea of Paradox but doesn’t want to get the depth.

Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.7. No Toxic/Incompetent People Allowed. We try very hard to screen out mean or stupid people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. You will never have to interact with someone who is an obvious idiot or straight up malicious. No toxic or incompetent people at work - could it really be? [Yes]8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here.9. Lots of Raises. We do our absolute best to get ahead of things and give raises preemptively, so you don't have to ask for one. It's not unusual at all for someone to receive 2+ raises per year.10. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.11. 4-6+ Weeks Vacation. We 100% want you to recharge, so having plenty of time off is absolutely worth it.12. Paid Maternity/Paternity Leave. We’ve even started letting people skip meetings during labor!13. Self-Funded So We Can Do What’s Right for Us. We don’t have to answer to anyone but ourselves, so we can make the right decision for the long-term health of the company vs trying to get big too fast or cut corners to appease some selfish investor.--What are your company’s values?--See here: http://www.jlstradingco.com/careers/Yes, those are legitimately our values. The careers page is definitely worth checking out - it’s not just normal corporate BS. We promise you’ll learn a lot about us.--OK, so I’ve read like 8 dang pages about you guys. Will you tell me what the actual job is?--No.--Wait... What?--OK fine. Super short version:Learning how to be a great designer from the ground up. We’re gonna teach you everything you need to know, and don’t care at all what your previous background is.Here is a bulleted list of responsibilities:- Go through our apprenticeship training program- Discover how we think about design from First Principles- Learn the tools of the trade- Practice, get feedback, iterate and repeat endlessly until you are an amazing designer (it takes LOTS of reps to get good at this stuff)--Do I need experience?--We expect you to have a minimum of 70 years of experience (120+ preferred).Oh, you haven't lived two lifetimes eating and breathing business 24/7/365? Who TF do you think you are, reading this job description? You absolute buffoon.Oh, you haven't been directly involved in at least two (preferably three) World Wars? You're not even qualified to operate our coffee machine, you sentient potato.Oh, you didn't observe the Big Bang as it happened? Get out of here, you pirated copy of Windows 95.I might throw up from your arrogance. The hubris to think that you, an absolute fool, could apply for an entry-level position... sickening. I’m literally shaking right now.Also, no you don't need any experience.We want special people, and don’t give AF what their background is. Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge.The Big Bang requirement still stands though.--Do I need a college degree?--You just need to be awesome.--Are there any geographic restrictions?--As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…--What is this apprentice program you speak of?--More info here: Apprenticeship Program. This program is specifically for designers, but the general apprentice program is quite relevant and basically the same (though with different content).--I’ve never designed before--Great! If you are smart and motivated and capable of self-learning, then we can likely teach you whatever you need to know. We don’t care if you have never designed before - we care about your potential.--I’ve been a designer for a long time--Great! Though we have to warn you that we will likely want to still build your knowledge from First Principles. We will teach you things that aren’t necessarily taught in design school (much to our chagrin), and we have certain ways of doing things that aren’t necessarily standard in the industry. We think they’re good, but they take some getting used to.--What type of things will I be designing?--Graphic design for sure, but also potentially:\\xa0 marketing material, packaging, products (industrial design), web stuff, and whatever else needs designing.We believe that design is a master skill with principles that transcend mediums, so we’ll teach you that base, and you can likely choose to specialize as you learn more of what you do and don’t like.--What are some more specific things that need designing?--Amazing listing images, social media ads, Standard Operating Procedures, random product inserts, some way for the CEO to stop being a crazy person, product packaging, silly postcards to people, products, etc.--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--You sound just like the tax authorities!--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--Please submit your information on the following page to apply.\\xa0We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!\\n\"}, {'title': 'Engineering Manager, Platform at Airalo', 'link': 'https://www.realworkfromanywhere.com/jobs/engineering-manager-platform-airalo-2850', 'pub_date': '', 'category': '', 'job_type': '', 'region': '', 'tags': '', 'description': 'About AiraloAlo!

The right assistance could transform their lives. But today, most never get it.Atticus makes it easy for any sick or injured person in crisis to get the life-changing aid they deserve. In the last 6 years, we’ve become the leading platform connecting people with disabilities to government benefits. We also help victims of accidents, misconduct, and violence get compensation from insurance. So far, we’ve gotten thousands of people access to over $4B in life-changing aid, and we’re just getting started.We've helped more than 110,000 people in need (see our 15,000+ five-star reviews) and raised more than $100 million from top VC firms like Fika, Forerunner, GV (Google Ventures), and True Ventures. (We closed our Series C round in April 2025, so we're well-funded for the foreseeable future.) We're small but moving fast — our team grew from 89 to over 151 last year, and we expect to grow again in 2025.The JobOur business is complex and multi-faceted: we play in an enormous space with huge barriers to entry, we have no direct competitors, and as a two-sided marketplace we have to coordinate multiple constituencies via a complex funnel that’s shaped by many different functional teams.To manage this complexity, the heart of our organization is a set of cross-functional go-to-market teams that own the P&L for our legal verticals, each run by a General Manager. These teams are not only responsible for managing budgets and staffing, but they also set the direction for the vertical as a whole: which channels to grow, what tests to run to improve conversion, how to balance dozens of strategic tradeoffs, and more.As GTM Lead, you’ll drive major initiatives to maximize the number of clients we serve in our Social Security Disability vertical. You’ll report to our General Manager (Peter Bailinson), and work closely with company leaders across marketing, product, client experience, operations, finance, and more. It’s a fast-paced and incredibly important job, requiring a full toolkit of skills, including strategy, implementation, team management, and most importantly, strong judgment.  In a typical week, you might do any of the following:Launch a new client acquisition channel through a rapid test-and-learn pilot. This could be a partnership with a Series E startup with an overlapping client base, a new digital marketing platform, scrappy OOH visual campaigns, or anything else you think could work.Lead a cross-functional team to integrate more AI into our client funnel. Build the financial model to assess the economics, select a vendor and evaluate their service, and make the call on whether the tooling is high-quality enough to test with our clients. Then, roll out the solution.Craft a plan to invest $750K into completely redoing our website. Interview 20 successful clients and 20 users who failed to retain a lawyer, research peer websites to create a prioritized list of features, and manage the agency we hire to tackle this project.The role is a rare opportunity to join a fast-growing Series C startup in a position that tackles the toughest challenges we face as a company, includes meaningful exposure and mentorship from company leadership (including our CEO), and is a clear pathway to both own a P&L and gain expertise in key functions like marketing and product. It’s designed to be a path to staying here and growing as an executive, or even starting your own company down the road.QualificationsWe are considering two distinct candidate profiles for this role:You started your career at a top consulting firm and have already made the leap to an operator role in an early-to-growth stage startup, with a track record of tackling initiatives that fueled company traction.You are still working at a top consulting firm, and have excelled to a remarkable degree compared to your peers (e.g., rapid promotions, taken on an unusual degree of ownership or responsibility).Regardless of the profile, we’ll evaluate candidates based on the following qualifications:Required:You’ve demonstrated insightful, decisive judgment when it comes to developing strategies, and you have a track record of making tough, smart tough calls among competing priorities.You’ve led teams of high-performing individual contributors (bonus points if they were cross-functional).You’ve steered projects where you mapped complex systems, gathered and analyzed data, made recommendations, and helped design and implement solutions.You’re a kind and thoughtful colleague who knows how to shape a great team culture, persuasively advocate for your ideas, and get buy-in from others.You have a demonstrated commitment to doing good and helping people.Bonus / Nice-to-Have:You have experience with marketplace businesses or complex consumer services (insurance, fintech, medical, real estate, etc.).You’ve done consumer-focused research or discovery work, or something else that makes you comfortable interviewing and empathizing with people from all walks of life.We are strongly committed to building a diverse team. If you’re from a background that’s underrepresented in tech, we’d love to meet you.Salary and BenefitsThis is a rare opportunity to join a startup that has strong traction (substantial funding, well-respected backers, tremendous growth, and many happy customers) but is still small enough that you can have a huge impact and play a role in shaping our culture.We’re a certified B Corporation tackling a critical social problem. Our mission to help people in need drives everything we do, and your work here will touch many lives.We offer competitive pay — including equity — and generous benefits:Medical and dental insurance with 100% of employee premiums covered15 vacation days & ~19 paid holidays each year (including two weeks at the end-of-year)Free membership to OneMedical$50/month internet stipend$1,000 reimbursable stipend for education and training outside of workUp to $1,200/year student loan repayment assistance401(k) and optional HSA/FSAHumble, thoughtful, smart, fun colleaguesWe anticipate the base salary band for this role will be between $150,000 and $180,000 in addition to equity and benefits. The salary at offer will be determined by a number of factors such as candidate’s experience, knowledge, skills and abilities, as well as internal equity among our team.LocationThis job is fully remote and we’re committed to empowering everyone with flexibility. Work remotely, and travel to LA (on the company dime) as needed to be with your colleagues —somewhere between quarterly and yearly.

      "This isn’t another product job.It’s the chance to define a new category : The Operating System (OS) for Human Greatness Augmented with AI.Science-backed. Design-led. AI-powered. Global.You’ll be working with the most complex data in the world : the human mind.Deep inside you are looking for a new adventure with…🚀Ambition : Smart teammates driven to create an iconic, international product🔥Impact : you strive to make a real difference in the company's growth, and not be a number in a big organization😍Mission : knowing your greatness left a mark in people's lives, through technology and behavioral scienceAt Paradox, we believe that greatness is trainable.That’s why we want to empower people at scale by leveraging cutting edge technologies like AI, and crafting user experiences with outstanding aesthetics.We do that by merging :- Human Intelligence (coaches, peers, and mentors)- Structured Intelligence (protocols, mental models, rituals),- Technological Intelligence (AI personalization, feedback loops, adaptive journeys)To create one seamless ecosystem: Paradox OS.This is why we are looking for a PM to make Paradox a category-defining global brand loved for its product.This is a full-time position from our beautiful offices in Dubai, Paris or Lisbon or remotely anywhere in the world.OUR BELIEFSWe believe self-help is broken.Most learning platforms are used the same way : consuming generic theories, getting quick highs, ending with no real change.At Paradox, we believe people deserve more.More than content. More than motivation.They deserve a system that knows them, one that adapts, challenges, and grows with them.We believe that every human learns differently, and that technology can do more than entertain or save time.It can translate insight into transformation, through AI personalization, lean experimentation, and deep psychological understanding.Because learning shouldn’t just make you feel inspired for a day, it should change how you live, think, and create.OUR VISIONAt Paradox, we want to re-invent how people grow.We do not build another course or coaching app but the Operating System for Greatness.Founded by David Laroche - a creator followed by over 2 million people and known for his interviews with icons like Tony Parker, Mike Horn, Richard Branson, and Gad Elmaleh, Paradox aims to build something that will live beyond any individual (including its founder), for decades to come.Our ambition is to compete with players like Mindvalley (150M ARR), but with a sharper vision, grounded protocols for achievers, people who want more for their life, refusing mediocrity.To do that, we bring together designers, tech, coaches, and filmmakers to create learning experiences that are cinematic, precise, and effective.We move fast, aim high, and hold ourselves to the standards of Apple, Spotify, and MasterClass. No fluff, focused on meaningful impact.While others hide their numbers, we want to let our results speak loudly for us.Get obsessed with transforming our clients’ lives and let those transformations be our marketing.YOUR MISSION 🚀-----------------------------------------As Product Manager, you’ll be the architect of a new category, transforming growth into a living ecosystem powered by AI, behavioral science, and design.You won’t just build features, you’ll craft experiences that rewire behavior.You’re the architect bringing clarity between vision and execution, the person who turns “we should build this” into “it’s live, here’s the data and tangible impact.”Every product cycle you lead will integrate:Protocols : guided frameworks grounded in psychology that rewire perception, emotion, and action.Pods : human connection, accountability, and shared rituals.Loops : adaptive, AI-powered coaching cycles that evolve with each user.Personalization : experiences that feel uniquely theirs, every time.Going from a successful personal brand, to an international tech-driven iconic brand, is far from easy. It will be messy, chaotic - requiring constant iterations on MVPs and innovation in tech. Therefore to achieve this here are :🎯 YOUR 6 MAIN MISSIONS-----------------------------------------1. Product Strategy :Translate the founder’s strategic vision into a clear product strategy.Build and maintain the roadmap that connects business goals, user outcomes, and technological innovation.Ensure every feature supports the evolution of the Paradox ecosystem: Loops, PX Agents, Protocols, Membership.2.

Build, Ship, Learn  FastApply Lean Startup methodology and scientific thinking to validate ideas through MVPs, not opinions.Design experiments and measurable success metrics before building.Iterate on a weekly basis on new hypothesis4. Product Analytics & Impact MeasurementDefine and track product success metrics (activation, retention, transformation rates).Connect data to business KPIs, know how your product drives lifetime value, not just engagement.We don’t track metrics just for internal dashboards, we track them also to prove transformation.Help marketing leverage this data to fuel authentic, evidence-based storytelling — showing the world what real transformation looks like.5. AI & Learning InnovationPrototype new experiences powered by AICut waste, challenge spending, increase marginOversee budgeting, reporting, planning, and auditing6. Blend emotions (“open the heart of people”) with precision (“build loops, scoring, protocols”).Create a visceral experience that translates into emotions of inspiration, awe from users.Use a Science-backed, Cinematic, Contrarian style : Every product touchpoint should be grounded in behavioral science, expressed with cinematic beauty, and challenge conventionsTHE IDEAL CANDIDATE 😍-----------------------------------------Experience :3–6 years as a Product Manager / Product Owner in EdTech, SaaS, or Consumer Tech.Bonus: experience in AI-driven products, learning design, or personal development platforms.You’ve shipped at least one major feature or product end-to-end, and can show measurable results.Uses Figma comfortably, prototypes directly.Traits :Craft-obsessed : You get things done, you love to work much beyond 9-5, you have a doer mentality, a bias for outcomes and want to be a beast in your fieldUser & Impact Obsessed: You think in outcomes, not outputs, you care about transformation.Analytical & System Thinker: You can turn a vague problem into a clear hypothesis, metrics, and roadmap.Digital & AI savvy : you’re able to build AI Agents (if not, you demonstrate ability to learn while applying).Cross-disciplinary Curiosity: You speak both tech and human; You can move from vision to spreadsheet to FigmaLanguageFrench : nativeEnglish: Fluent English, you can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues.Our chosen language for written communication is English.IT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU--------------------------------❌ If you need clarity before chaos — wrong place.❌ If you prefer balance over intensity — wrong season.❌ If you build to deliver, not to elevate — wrong mission.❌Surface-level Vision Alignment : Like the idea of Paradox but doesn’t want to get the depth.

No fluff, focused on meaningful impact.While others hide their numbers, we want to let our results speak loudly for us.Get obsessed with transforming our clients’ lives and let those transformations be our marketing.YOUR MISSION 🚀-----------------------------------------As Product Manager, you’ll be the architect of a new category, transforming growth into a living ecosystem powered by AI, behavioral science, and design.You won’t just build features, you’ll craft experiences that rewire behavior.You’re the architect bringing clarity between vision and execution, the person who turns “we should build this” into “it’s live, here’s the data and tangible impact.”Every product cycle you lead will integrate:Protocols : guided frameworks grounded in psychology that rewire perception, emotion, and action.Pods : human connection, accountability, and shared rituals.Loops : adaptive, AI-powered coaching cycles that evolve with each user.Personalization : experiences that feel uniquely theirs, every time.Going from a successful personal brand, to an international tech-driven iconic brand, is far from easy. It will be messy, chaotic - requiring constant iterations on MVPs and innovation in tech. Therefore to achieve this here are :🎯 YOUR 6 MAIN MISSIONS-----------------------------------------1. Product Strategy :Translate the founder’s strategic vision into a clear product strategy.Build and maintain the roadmap that connects business goals, user outcomes, and technological innovation.Ensure every feature supports the evolution of the Paradox ecosystem: Loops, PX Agents, Protocols, Membership.2. User Understanding & Behavioral InsightBe obsessed with user problems : talk to users weekly, analyze patterns, and identify where transformation breaks.Turn insights from behavioral science, coaching psychology, and learning design into actionable product hypotheses.Design loops, feedback, and rituals that make growth tangible.build for both the heart (inspiration) and the brain (structure).3. Build, Ship, Learn FastApply Lean Startup methodology and scientific thinking to validate ideas through MVPs, not opinions.Design experiments and measurable success metrics before building.Iterate on a weekly basis on new hypothesis4. Product Analytics & Impact MeasurementDefine and track product success metrics (activation, retention, transformation rates).Connect data to business KPIs, know how your product drives lifetime value, not just engagement.We don’t track metrics just for internal dashboards, we track them also to prove transformation.Help marketing leverage this data to fuel authentic, evidence-based storytelling — showing the world what real transformation looks like.5. AI & Learning InnovationPrototype new experiences powered by AICut waste, challenge spending, increase marginOversee budgeting, reporting, planning, and auditing6. Blend emotions (“open the heart of people”) with precision (“build loops, scoring, protocols”).Create a visceral experience that translates into emotions of inspiration, awe from users.Use a Science-backed, Cinematic, Contrarian style : Every product touchpoint should be grounded in behavioral science, expressed with cinematic beauty, and challenge conventionsTHE IDEAL CANDIDATE 😍-----------------------------------------Experience :3–6 years as a Product Manager / Product Owner in EdTech, SaaS, or Consumer Tech.Bonus: experience in AI-driven products, learning design, or personal development platforms.You’ve shipped at least one major feature or product end-to-end, and can show measurable results.Uses Figma comfortably, prototypes directly.Traits :Craft-obsessed : You get things done, you love to work much beyond 9-5, you have a doer mentality, a bias for outcomes and want to be a beast in your fieldUser & Impact Obsessed: You think in outcomes, not outputs, you care about transformation.Analytical & System Thinker: You can turn a vague problem into a clear hypothesis, metrics, and roadmap.Digital & AI savvy : you’re able to build AI Agents (if not, you demonstrate ability to learn while applying).Cross-disciplinary Curiosity: You speak both tech and human; You can move from vision to spreadsheet to FigmaLanguageFrench : nativeEnglish: Fluent English, you can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues.Our chosen language for written communication is English.IT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU--------------------------------❌ If you need clarity before chaos — wrong place.❌ If you prefer balance over intensity — wrong season.❌ If you build to deliver, not to elevate — wrong mission.❌Surface-level Vision Alignment : Like the idea of Paradox but doesn’t want to get the depth.
